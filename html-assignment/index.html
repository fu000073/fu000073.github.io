        <p>
            Hi, everyone! I am Wenting Fu. You can also call me <em>Florence</em>. I come from China. Previously I studied Japanese and Accounting for my undergraduate degree. And now I am very happy to join this new course. I'm always been drawn to the designing and coding which is why I'm excited to be a part of the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program here.

            In my spare time, I love doing workout and going on hikes. I have 6 pack! I also have a cute dog named Bao. He is a 3-year-old golden retriver who loves tennis ball beats everything in the world! I am very excited to be here! By the way,I just came to Canada and I just want to know where are the good places for hiking?
